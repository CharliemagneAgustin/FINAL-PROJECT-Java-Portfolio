For a collection of five books, the MyBookList application employs a Book class to record particular information such as titles, authors, and years. It begins by listing each book together with its current page, which starts at zero. By altering the page numbers for particular books, the program can then function as a bookmark. For example, it can set Rich Dad Poor Dad to page 50. It also makes it possible to change other information, such as an author's name if it was entered incorrectly.


Lastly, a unique filter is used by the computer to search the list for books according to their age. Every book's "year published" is examined, and only titles released after 2010 are printed. This makes it very easy to organize a library, update your reading progress, and quickly find the newest books on the shelf.
