The CoffeeShop program tracks various customers who visit a store in a manner similar to a digital rewards card system. Each person's name and the number of points they have earned from purchasing coffee are stored using a Customer class. When a consumer makes a purchase, the program can automatically add points, for example, giving "Peter" 220 points or allow them to spend points to receive a free drink.

Additionally, the code uses a common counter to maintain a running total of each consumer who has enrolled in the system. Everyone's balance can be checked to determine if they have enough points to receive a reward. For instance, it indicates that "Joseph" can redeem a prize since he has enough points, but the "Unknown" consumer cannot. This makes it simple for a shop to manage its fans and see who deserves a special treat.
