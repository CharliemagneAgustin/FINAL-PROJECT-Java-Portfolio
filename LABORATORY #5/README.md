The TeacherStudentAssignment program organizes all students and teachers into a single, broad category known as a Person, much like a school organizer. Each individual has a name, age, and gender, but the program is intelligent enough to recognize that teachers and students have different information. For instance, it records unique student IDs for children such as "Charlie" and "Keimi," and for teachers such as "Pol Orio," it records their department and a list of the particular courses they instruct.

The program labels classes with codes such as "CS60" for Data Structures using a Course template. The primary portion of the code generates lists of teachers and students, gives each teacher a specific class, and then outputs a large report. It can show a simple list of basic info for everyone, or it can dive deep to show exactly which teacher is handling which subject, like "Johnroe" teaching mulitple courses, for example, Fundamentals in Programming.
